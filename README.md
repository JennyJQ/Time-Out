# Time-Out

Second Place Winner of TurnerHacks 2018. First place prize for GPS integration. A productivity app that keeps users focused on their task
for a specific period of time. Once time is up, the user can perform leisure activities, such as playing built-in games. Using resources
like GeoHub, productivity has never been more fun!

The 'TunerHacks2018' folder contains all the elements regarding the GPS game inside the application. This is necessary as that part of the
application was created on a different computer in a different project. It merges the two projects by using a project reference to open and
close the forms associated with that part of the application.
